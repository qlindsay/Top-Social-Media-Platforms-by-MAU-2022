# Top-Social-Media-Platforms-by-MAU-2022

MAU is a key KPI within the social media space, as it tracks the number of monthly active users and can help determine how much revenue a company is generating from users. MAU can also help companies measure churn, which is a measurement of the percentage of accounts that cancel or choose not to renew their subscriptions.
Goal: My goal here was to show the top 5 social media platforms by MAU for 2022.
